##  Project Overview

**FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEM** is a streamlined facial recognition tool that lets you:
- Detect and recognize faces in images or real-time (e.g., webcam feed) 📸  
- Train your own face datasets and match identities accurately 🎯  
- Integrate seamlessly into authentication systems, attendance apps, or smart interfaces 🤖  

---
Example Usage
- Capture live webcam feed  
- Face detected: "Visitor matched as: John Doe"  
- Unrecognized face: "Unknown person — registering as: Jane Doe"
